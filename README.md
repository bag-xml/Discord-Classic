# Discord Classic
## The definitive way of using Discord on legacy iOS.


# Encountering issues, or need support?
If you're encountering issues you should always take note of what happens, how you triggered it, what your iOS version is, what device type (Doesn't matter if iPod but iPad is more important) you're using Discord Classic on and then open a new issue on the [issues tab](https://github.com/bag-xml/iOS-Discord-Classic/issues).
